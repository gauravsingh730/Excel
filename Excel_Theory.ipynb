        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In Excel, cell referencing determines how a cell address behaves when you copy or drag a formula to other cells. The primary difference lies in the use of the dollar sign ($), which acts as a \"lock\" for specific rows or columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Relative Cell Reference (The Default)**\n",
        "\n",
        "A Relative Reference adjusts automatically based on the position where the formula is pasted. If you move the formula one row down, the reference moves one row down.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Format: A1 (No dollar signs)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Best for: Repeating the same calculation across a series of rows or columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Example: If you have a price in A2 and quantity in B2, you might write =A2*B2 in cell C2.\n",
        "  - When you drag this down to C3, it automatically changes to =A3*B3.\n",
        "  - When you drag it to C4, it becomes =A4*B4.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Absolute Cell Reference**\n",
        "\n",
        "An Absolute Reference stays fixed on one specific cell, no matter where you copy the formula. You \"lock\" both the column and the row.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Format: \\$A\\$1(Dollar signs before both column and row)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Best for: Referring to a single constant value, like a Tax Rate, Commission % or Discount.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Example: Suppose you have a Tax Rate in cell E1 (e.g., 10%) and a list of prices in column A. In cell B2, you write: =`A2*$E$1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - When you drag this down to B3, it becomes =`A3*$E$1`.\n",
        "  - The price reference (A2) moves, but the tax rate (E1) stays locked.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Mixed Cell Reference**\n",

        "Text Functions in Excel are a category of built-in formulas specifically designed to manipulate, format, and extract data from text strings (also known as alphanumeric data).
